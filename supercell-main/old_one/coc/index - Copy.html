        <h1>Purpose?</h1>
        <p>The ultimate goal in Clash of Clans is to beat other players and be a part of a winning clan. First few days player is protected from
             attacks from other players but once this shield is dropped you become free game. In other words, after the shield is dropped your
              village will be destroyed between 1 - 3 times a day.</p>

    <div class="u" id="u">
        <h1>Townhall?</h1>
        <p>The Town Hall is equivalent to the Builder Hall in the Builder Base, or the Goblin Hall in the Single Player Campaigns. Placement of the 
            Town Hall outside a farming base serves no purpose, other than to rapidly drop trophies.</p>

    <div class="y" id="y">
        <h1>Builderhall?</h1>
        <p>The Builder Hall is the equivalent of the Town Hall in the Builder Base. Protection of the Builder Hall is critical for preventing players
             from getting one star on your base in an attack.</p>
