        <p style="text-align: center;margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%; color: rgb(248, 85, 85); font-size: 50px;"><b>Healer </b>  </p>
        <hr style="color: darkgray; margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%;margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px;">
        <p style="text-align: center;margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%; color: white; font-size: 20px;"><b>The Healer is a flying unit that is unlocked at Barracks level 8. She is the only troop with no attacking capabilities, but can heal any ground troops.</b>  </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p style="text-align: center;margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%; color: white; font-size: 20px;"><b>When the Healer is deployed, a pulsating circular aura appears around her. She will heal the closest unit or Hero to her, regardless of how damaged they are. For example, if she has already locked on to your Archer Queen, she will not heal anything else until the Archer Queen is destroyed.</b>  </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p style="text-align: center;margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%; color: white; font-size: 20px;"><b>Note that Healers will not heal air units (other Healers, Dragons, Balloons, Minions, Lava Hounds, etc.), unlike a Healing Spell which heals every kind of troop. Healers will also not heal ground Siege Machines like the Wall Wrecker.</b>  </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p style="text-align: center;margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%; color: white; font-size: 20px;"><b>Note that Healers will heal heroes at a reduced rate different from that of other units but Hero Walks (A Ranged Hero combined with 4-6 Healers) are still very popular in attack strategies; keep this in mind when using Healers with your heroes.</b>  </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p style="text-align: center;margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%; color: white; font-size: 20px;"><b>Healers cannot attack at all. They are completely unable to defend themselves, and will totally ignore any enemy buildings or troops attacking them. If they have no target to heal, they will simply remain stationary even if they are taking damage.</b>  </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p style="text-align: center;margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%; color: white; font-size: 20px;"><b>When defending as a Clan Castle troop, she heals injured Clan Castle troops, Heroes and the Skeletons from Skeleton Trap.</b>  </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p style="text-align: center;margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%; color: white; font-size: 20px;"><b>Unlike all other troops, Healers are measured in healing per second (abbreviated as HPS; stated in-game as "Heal"), rather than in damage per second. </b>  </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p style="text-align: center;margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%; color: white; font-size: 20px;"><b>Each additional healer affecting the same unit after the fourth will have a reduced effect on healing the unit. Only up to nine Healers can have an effect on a unit at a time. </b>  </p>
