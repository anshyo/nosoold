She is a slow and expensive single-target melee Elixir Troop that occupies a big amount of housing space but comes with large amounts of hitpoints and damage.</b>  </p>

        <p style="text-align: center;margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%; color: white; font-size: 20px;"><b>P.E.K.K.As have no preferred target when attacking; they will simply attack the closest building. However, once they become aware of enemy Clan Castle troops, Heroes, or Skeleton Trap skeletons (either by being attacked themselves or by being near another friendly troop under attack), they will leave their previously targeted building and instead engage the enemy troops. Once all of the nearby enemy troops are defeated, the P.E.K.K.As will proceed to attack the nearest structure. </b>  </p>
