They act like regular Barbarians wearing pumpkin helmets that prevents them from being killed in one shot, like the shields in Clash Royale. However, they can still be bounced away by Spring Traps.</b>  </p>

        <p style="text-align: center;margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%; color: white; font-size: 20px;"><b>Like all other temporary troops and spells, the Pumpkin Barbarian can't be donated, and can't be upgraded in the Laboratory. However, their levels are dependent on the Town Hall level.</b>  </p>

        <p style="text-align: center;margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%; color: white; font-size: 20px;"><b>Pumpkin Barbarians have no preferred target when attacking; they will simply attack the closest building. However, once they become aware of enemy Clan Castle troops, Heroes, or Skeleton Trap skeletons (either by being attacked themselves or by being near another friendly troop under attack), they will leave their previously targeted building and instead engage the enemy troops. Once all of the nearby enemy troops are defeated, the Pumpkin Barbarians will proceed to attack the nearest structure. </b>  </p>
