        <hr style="color: darkgray; margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%;margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px;">
        <p style="text-align: center;margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%; color: white; font-size: 20px;"><b>The Party Wizard is a temporary troop available during the 7th, 8th, and 9th anniversaries of Clash of Clans.</b>  </p>

        <br>
        <p style="text-align: center;margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%; color: white; font-size: 20px;"><b>Party Wizards are specially-themed Wizards. They differ from regular Wizards in that they have increased damage output, faster movement speed, and also attack and retarget faster, but they have less hitpoints.</b>  </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p style="text-align: center;margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%; color: white; font-size: 20px;"><b>Party Wizards have no preferred target when attacking; they will simply attack the closest building. However, once they become aware of enemy Clan Castle troops, Heroes, or Skeleton Trap skeletons (either by being attacked themselves or by being near another friendly troop under attack), they will leave their previously targeted building and instead engage the enemy troops. Once all of the nearby enemy troops are defeated, the Party Wizards will proceed to attack the nearest structure. </b>  </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p style="text-align: center;margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%; color: white; font-size: 20px;"><b>Party Wizards cannot be upgraded in the Laboratory. Instead, its statistics depend on the player's Town Hall level. Laboratory level does not affect statistics whatsoever. The statistics for a particular Town Hall level is based on the stats of the maximum level of Wizards available at that Town Hall level but with +50% extra damage per second and -20% hitpoints.</b>  </p>

        <br>
        <p style="text-align: center;margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%; color: white; font-size: 20px;"><b>Like other temporary troops, they cannot be donated to Clan Castles.</b>  </p>
