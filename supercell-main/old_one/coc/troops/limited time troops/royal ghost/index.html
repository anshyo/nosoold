        <p style="text-align: center;margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%; color: rgb(248, 85, 85); font-size: 50px;"><b>Royal Ghost</b>  </p>
        <hr style="color: darkgray; margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%;margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px;">
        <p style="text-align: center;margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%; color: white; font-size: 20px;"><b>The Royal Ghost is a temporary Halloween troop added for the Halloween 2019 season. </b>  </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p style="text-align: center;margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%; color: white; font-size: 20px;"><b>The Royal Ghost has very high damage per second but very low hitpoints. However, for 12 seconds after deployment, he is invisible and cannot be targeted by defenses, similar to Sneaky Archers in the Builder Base.</b>  </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p style="text-align: center;margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%; color: white; font-size: 20px;"><b>Royal Ghosts have no preferred target when attacking; they will simply attack the closest building. However, once they become aware of enemy Clan Castle troops, Heroes, or Skeleton Trap skeletons (either by being attacked themselves or by being near another friendly troop under attack), they will leave their previously targeted building and instead engage the enemy troops. Once all of the nearby enemy troops are defeated, the Royal Ghosts will proceed to attack the nearest structure.</b>  </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p style="text-align: center;margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%; color: white; font-size: 20px;"><b>Like the Sneaky Archer, the Royal Ghost's invisibility does not prevent him from being harmed by traps or splash projectiles attacking another troop. While invisible, however, the Royal Ghost is able to pass through Walls.</b>  </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p style="text-align: center;margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%; color: white; font-size: 20px;"><b>Like other temporary troops, they cannot be donated to Clan Castles.</b>  </p>
