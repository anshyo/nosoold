Yetis possess above-average health and attack compared to most damage units. When deployed, they carry a set amount of Yetimites; for every 600 damage it takes, the Yeti spawns a Yetimite, if it still has any remaining. Once destroyed, the Yeti releases any remaining Yetimites it still has.</b>  </p>

        <p style="text-align: center;margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%; color: white; font-size: 20px;"><b>Yetis have no preferred target when attacking; they will simply attack the closest building. However, once they become aware of enemy Clan Castle troops, Heroes, or Skeleton Trap skeletons (either by being attacked themselves or by being near another friendly troop under attack), they will leave their previously targeted building and instead engage the enemy troops. Once all of the nearby enemy troops are defeated, the Yetis will proceed to attack the nearest structure.</b>  </p>
