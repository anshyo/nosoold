She wears a short, light green dress, a hooded cape, a leather belt, and an attached small pouch. She has a quiver slung on her back, a gold short bow in her left hand, and a golden band on each of her upper arms. </b>  </p>

        <p style="text-align: center;margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%; color: white; font-size: 20px;"><b>Archers have no preferred target when attacking; they will simply attack the closest building. However, once they become aware of enemy Clan Castle troops, Heroes, or Skeleton Trap skeletons (either by being attacked themselves or by being near another friendly troop under attack), they will leave their previously targeted building and instead engage the enemy troops. Once all of the nearby enemy troops are defeated, the Archers will proceed to attack the nearest structure. </b>  </p>
