        <p style="text-align: center;margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%; color: white; font-size: 20px;"><b>The Electro Dragon is the 13th troop unlocked in the Barracks. They are powerful, single-target air units with mediocre health and high damage. </b>  </p>

        <p style="text-align: center;margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%; color: white; font-size: 20px;"><b>Electro Dragons have no preferred target when attacking; they will simply attack the closest building. However, once they become aware of enemy Clan Castle troops, Heroes, or Skeleton Trap skeletons (either by being attacked themselves or by being near another friendly troop under attack), they will leave their previously targeted building and instead engage the enemy troops. Once all of the nearby enemy troops are defeated, the Electro Dragons will proceed to attack the nearest structure.</b>  </p>

        <p style="text-align: center;margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%; color: white; font-size: 20px;"><b>When the Electro Dragon attacks, its bolt can hit up to 4 others, with each successive hit inflicting 20% less damage than the previous one.</b>  </p>

        <p style="text-align: center;margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%; color: white; font-size: 20px;"><b>When destroyed, the Electro Dragon causes the nearby ground to be struck with lightning bolts in a similar fashion to the old Lightning Spell.</b>  </p>
