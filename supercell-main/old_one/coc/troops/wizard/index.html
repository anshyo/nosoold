        <p style="text-align: center;margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%; color: white; font-size: 20px;"><b>The Wizard is a ranged troop unlocked in the level 7 Barracks. He shoots fireballs or energy blasts that do high damage but requires support as he has relatively low hit points and can easily be killed by point defenses.</b>  </p>

        <p style="text-align: center;margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%; color: white; font-size: 20px;"><b>Wizards are commonly used in large groups for fire support or as a force multiplier (similar to Archers), but they can also be effective in smaller numbers, especially at lower levels.</b>  </p>

        <p style="text-align: center;margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%; color: white; font-size: 20px;"><b>Wizards have no preferred target when attacking; they will simply attack the closest building. However, once they become aware of enemy Clan Castle troops, Heroes, or Skeleton Trap skeletons (either by being attacked themselves or by being near another friendly troop under attack), they will leave their previously targeted building and instead engage the enemy troops. Once all of the nearby enemy troops are defeated, the Wizards will proceed to attack the nearest structure.</b>  </p>
