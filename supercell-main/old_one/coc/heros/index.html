        <h1>BARBARIAN KING :-</h1>
        <p>The Barbarian King is the first hero unlocked at Town Hall level 7. He is a larger, stronger, more aggressive, more impressive, and more powerful Barbarian.
            He is automatically summoned once the Barbarian King Altar is constructed, which costs 5,000 Dark Elixir. So, the Dark Elixir Storage is required to get him.
            The Barbarian King is an immortal unit (since he is a hero), so he only has to be summoned once. However, if he is injured or gets defeated in an attack, he must regenerate his health by sleeping for a period of time before he can be used again. The maximum period needed for him to regenerate depends on his level; the higher it is, the longer it takes for him to regenerate.</p>

        <h1>ARCHER QUEEN :-</h1>
        <p>The Archer Queen is essentially a more powerful version of the Archer. She is the second Hero, being unlocked at Town Hall 9. In addition to possessing much higher damage and hitpoints, the Archer Queen also shoots 1.5 tiles farther than a normal Archer (5 tiles instead of 3.5 tiles).
            The Archer Queen shoots 3 rapid arrows per shot. However, these arrows deal damage to a single target.
            She is automatically summoned once the Archer Queen Altar is constructed, which costs 10,000 Dark Elixir.
            The Archer Queen is an immortal unit, so she only has to be summoned once. However, if she is injured or gets defeated in an attack, she must regenerate her health by sleeping for a period of time before she can be used again.</p>

        <h1>GRAND WARDEN :-</h1>
        <p>The Grand Warden is a single-target unit unlocked at Town Hall level 11. He is the third hero in the game, being weak in physical strength and self-defense but extremely powerful in support.
            He is automatically summoned once the Grand Warden Altar is constructed, which costs 2,000,000 Elixir. Uniquely for Heroes in the Home Village, he is upgraded with Elixir instead of Dark Elixir.
            He can be set to Air or Ground mode; he flies in Air Mode and walks in Ground Mode.
            He can bypass Walls regardless of the mode he is set to; however, he will attack a Wall if the majority of your nearby housing space is doing so as well.</p>

        <h1>ROYAL CHAMPIAN :-</h1>
        <p>The Royal Champion is the fourth Hero in the Home Village. She has moderately high DPS, moderate health, and targets defenses. She can also jump over Walls, much like the Hog Rider.
            She throws her spear from a distance to attack enemy buildings.
            She is automatically summoned once the Royal Champion Altar is constructed, which is available at Town Hall level 13.
            Like the other Heroes, the Royal Champion only needs to be summoned once, but will have to spend some time regenerating her health if she is damaged during a battle.</p>

        <h1>BATTLE MACHINE :-</h1>
        <p>Battle Machine is the first Hero (and currently the only one) in the Builder Base. It requires a level 5 Builder Hall and 900,000 Builder Elixir to repair.
            The Battle Machine is a single-target melee unit that smashes nearby buildings with its hammer.
            It sits atop the Battle Machine Altar when not attacking.
            Unlike the other heroes, the Battle Machine will not defend (since both players attack each other simultaneously), the Battle Machine is either fighting something else or is being upgraded and can't fight.</p>
